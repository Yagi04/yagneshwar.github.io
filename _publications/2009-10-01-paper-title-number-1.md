excerpt: 'In this paper, we present a Multi-System Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for multi-zone building automation. We develop a MPC-based approach to optimize the performance of interconnected systems, such as HVAC, lighting, and energy management, in multi-zone buildings.Our goal is to enhance energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and system coordination while managing the complexities of multi-zone control.We propose a predictive control strategy that integrates real-time data, accounts for system interactions, and optimizes control decisions across multiple building zones simultaneously. Through simulations and performance evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements in energy savings and system efficiency compared to traditional control methods.'
